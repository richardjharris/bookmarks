Edit: modal box
Delete: ask if sure (maybe support shift modifier to suppress?)

Animations to make it easier to see how items are disappearing and appearing
Proper validation (client and server-side) for forms.
Mobile UI. Maybe buttons for add. Todo is not really needed or could be put
  first in the tag list.

Can enable Anonymous firebase user - then link the anonymous user id
to a new user! Keeps data saved. (I think)
Other auth for firestore - not sure yet. We don't need to use /users/$id/etc
  anymore.

Context can be used to pass 'global' data, such as preferred language, theme or authed
user, so it doesn't have to be passed down.
An alternative for some things is to pass an entire element down the chain.
